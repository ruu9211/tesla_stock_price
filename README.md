# üìà Tesla Stock Price Prediction ‚Äî Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

## üìå Overview

Forecasting stock prices is a complex and high-impact task in financial analytics due to the inherent volatility and noise in market data. This project leverages **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequential data, to model and predict the closing price of Tesla stock.

The dataset comprises historical stock metrics such as ```Open```, ```High```, ```Low```, ```Close```, and ```Volume```, recorded on a daily basis. The objective is to develop a predictive model that captures the temporal dependencies in stock behaviour to forecast future closing prices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Data Acquisition | Loaded daily Tesla stock data with features including ```Open```, ```High```, ```Low```, ```Close```, and ```Volume```. |
| 2. Data Preprocessing | - Normalized values using `MinMaxScaler`<br>- Generated input sequences with sliding window approach (window size = 14)<br>- Split data into training and testing sets |
| 3. Model Architecture | Built a deep LSTM model with:<br>‚Üí Two stacked `LSTM` layers<br>‚Üí One fully connected `Dense` layer<br>‚Üí `Dropout` layer for regularization |
| 4. Model Training | Compiled with the `Adam` optimizer and `mean_squared_error` loss; used `EarlyStopping` to monitor validation loss and avoid overfitting. |
| 5. Prediction & Inversion | Predicted scaled values and inverse-transformed them using the scaler to obtain actual stock price predictions. |
| 6. Evaluation | Evaluated model using `MAE` and `RMSE` to quantify prediction accuracy. |
| 7. Visualization | Plotted actual vs predicted stock prices to assess temporal alignment. |

## üí° Key Insights

- **Temporal Modeling**: LSTM networks are highly effective for learning sequential dependencies in time-series data such as stock prices.
- **Data Preparation**: Proper normalization and sequence generation were critical for model performance.
- **Overfitting Control**: `EarlyStopping` callback based on validation loss helped reduce overfitting and preserved model generalization.
- **Real-World Challenges**: Missing dates (e.g., weekends, holidays) are typical in stock market data and must be accounted for in the modeling process.
