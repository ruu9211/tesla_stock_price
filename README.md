# üìà Tesla Stock Price Prediction ‚Äî LSTM (Time Series)

## üìå Overview

Forecasting stock prices is a complex and high-impact task in financial analytics due to the inherent volatility and noise in market data. This project leverages **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequential data, to model and predict the closing price of Tesla stock.

The dataset comprises historical stock metrics such as ```Open```, ```High```, ```Low```, ```Close```, and ```Volume```, recorded on a daily basis. The objective is to develop a predictive model that captures the temporal dependencies in stock behaviour to forecast future closing prices.

## üéØ Project Objective

Develop a deep learning model using LSTM architecture to predict Tesla‚Äôs stock **closing price** by learning from historical patterns in time series data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Data Acquisition | Loaded daily Tesla stock data with features including ```Open```, ```High```, ```Low```, ```Close```, and ```Volume```. |
| 2. Data Preprocessing | - Normalized values using `MinMaxScaler`<br>- Generated input sequences with sliding window approach (window size = 14)<br>- Split data into training and testing sets |
| 3. Model Architecture | Built a deep LSTM model with:<br>‚Üí Two stacked `LSTM` layers<br>‚Üí One fully connected `Dense` layer<br>‚Üí `Dropout` layer for regularization |
| 4. Model Training | Compiled with the `Adam` optimizer and `mean_squared_error` loss; used `EarlyStopping` to monitor validation loss and avoid overfitting. |
| 5. Prediction & Inversion | Predicted scaled values and inverse-transformed them using the scaler to obtain actual stock price predictions. |
| 6. Evaluation | Evaluated model using `MAE` and `RMSE` to quantify prediction accuracy. |
| 7. Visualization | Plotted actual vs predicted stock prices to assess temporal alignment. |

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To better understand the behaviour and relationships within the stock price data, several exploratory visualizations were generated:

### 1. Open vs Close Prices Over Time
A multi-year line plot was created to visualize `Open` and `Close` price trends. This graph illustrates how the stock opened and closed each trading day over time. The overlay helps identify:

- Annual trends in stock volatility and growth.
- Market momentum and directional shifts across years.

### 2. High vs Low Price Relationship
A scatter plot comparing `High` vs `Low` prices confirms a strong linear relationship, as expected. Key insights include:

- Daily price ranges are relatively tight with few outliers.
- A nearly 1:1 trend indicates typical intraday trading stability.
- Occasional wider spreads may point to higher volatility sessions.

### 3. Open vs Close Price Relationship
This scatter plot compares `Open` and `Close` prices to assess how often the stock ends higher or lower than it starts:

- Points above the diagonal represent positive days.
- Points below the diagonal represent negative days.
- The clustering around the diagonal indicates many days with minimal change.

### 4. Correlation Matrix
A correlation heatmap was generated to identify statistical relationships between all numerical features:

- Strong positive correlation between `Open`, `High`, `Low`, and `Close` prices.
- `Volume` shows relatively weak correlation with price-based features, suggesting it behaves independently.
- The heatmap supports feature selection and can help inform future multivariate modeling.

## üí° Key Insights

- **Temporal Modeling**: LSTM networks are highly effective for learning sequential dependencies in time-series data such as stock prices.
- **Data Preparation**: Proper normalization and sequence generation were critical for model performance.
- **Overfitting Control**: `EarlyStopping` callback based on validation loss helped reduce overfitting and preserved model generalization.
